## Tips
- Broken fonts and icons
    Make sure you have "Nerd Fonts"
    You can install just clicking `*.ttf` file.
    But I recommend installing as a tff for all users.

## Review
- Same behavior as `VIM`
    - If you're a `CLI` user who is familiar with `VIM`, it's great.
    - Very difficult to learn for users used to the `GUI`.
- High degree of freedom
    - The wide world of customization opens up a whole new world for those who want to customize their text editor.
